# 🌌 Glow

**An Immersive, Modular, Living Social Platform**

> Communities are worlds. Content is architecture. UI is alive.

## What is Glow?

Glow is a next-generation social platform designed around **immersive communities**, **deep personalization**, and **living visual systems**. It is not just a place to post content — it is a framework where people, spaces, and content become **contextual objects** with identity, behavior, and aesthetics.

Glow synthesizes concepts from:
- Community platforms
- Chat systems
- Classic forums
- Creative tools
- Live visual engines

...into a single coherent ecosystem.

The core idea is simple:

> **Communities are worlds. Content is architecture. UI is alive.**

---

## Core Philosophy

### Context First
Nothing exists in isolation. Every action, post, message, or identity exists within a **context** (Global, Space, Channel).

### Identity is Fluid
A user is not a single static profile. Identity **adapts** per Space, per Channel, per interaction.

### Visuals Communicate Meaning
Colors, borders, glow, motion, and depth are **semantic**, not decorative. They communicate hierarchy, ownership, relevance, and status.

### Modular by Design
Everything in Glow is modular: Spaces, Channels, Entries, Blocks, Themes, Effects. Nothing is hard-coded to one use case.

---

## Content Architecture

### 🌍 Global — The Universal Lobby

**Global** is the entry layer of Glow. It is not a community — it is a **cross-space convergence zone**.

#### Purpose
- Discover Spaces
- Observe activity across the platform
- See highlighted content
- Follow creators or projects
- Publish cross-topic content

Global acts as a **lobby**, **discovery feed**, **trend surface**, and **bridge between worlds**.

#### What You Can Do in Global
- Browse featured Spaces
- View trending Entries
- Filter by hashtags
- Comment on public Entries
- Publish content not tied to a specific Space
- Follow users or Spaces

#### What You Cannot Do in Global
- Deep roleplay
- Space-specific systems
- Internal Channel activity

**Global is wide, not deep.** Depth happens inside Spaces.

---

### 🪐 Spaces — The Heart of Glow

A **Space** is a fully self-contained thematic world.

**Examples**: Naruto, Game Development, Music Production, Art & Illustration, Roleplay Universes, Research Communities

Each Space is:
- **Independent** - Self-governed
- **Customizable** - Unique visual identity
- **Governed** - Own rules and moderation
- **Visually distinct** - Different aesthetic per Space

#### What Defines a Space

A Space configures:
- **Theme and aesthetic** - Colors, glow behavior, backgrounds, glassmorphism levels
- **Rules and moderation** - Governance and permissions
- **Internal structure** - Channels, sections, categories
- **Cultural tone** - Community vibe and interaction style
- **Visual behavior** - Static or animated UI, entry defaults, chat appearance

**This means every Space feels different, even though the app is the same.**

#### Space Customization

A Space can configure:
- Primary and secondary colors
- Glow behavior
- Backgrounds
- Glassmorphism levels
- Static or animated UI
- Entry defaults
- Chat appearance

#### Space Governance

Spaces define:
- Staff roles
- Permissions
- Posting rules
- Highlighted sections
- Featured content
- Filters and categories

**A Space is not just a feed — it is an environment.**

---

### 🧩 Channels — Micro-Worlds Inside Spaces

**Channels** are sub-environments inside a Space. They are **not just chats**.

#### What a Channel Contains

A Channel can include **simultaneously**:

- 💬 **Chat** - Real-time instant messaging
- 🎙️ **Voice** - Audio communication
- 🧱 **Entries** - Persistent structured content
- 🎭 **Masks** - Channel-specific identity (nicknames, temporary avatars, roles)

**Channels are not "chat rooms" — they are hybrid living spaces.**

#### Channel Use Cases
- Roleplay groups
- Clan systems
- Staff coordination
- Lore archives
- Closed projects
- Private collaboration

#### Visibility Control

Channels can be:
- **Public** - Open to all Space members
- **Restricted** - Role-based access
- **Private** - Invite-only
- **Role-locked** - Permission-gated

**Content inside a Channel does not have to surface to the Space or Global.**

Channels allow **segmentation without fragmentation**, **specialization without isolation**.

---

### 🧱 Entries — Living Content, Not Posts

**Entries are not posts.** They are **structured, living documents** built using **Smart Blocks**.

#### What Makes Entries Different

Entries:
- Are **modular** - Built from composable blocks
- Support **layout** - Visual hierarchy and structure
- Support **visual hierarchy** - Organized presentation
- Can behave like **web pages** - Rich, interactive content
- Can be **reused or templated** - Consistent formatting

#### Smart Blocks

Smart Blocks are the building units of Entries:

- Text blocks
- Containers
- Separators
- Layers
- Backgrounds
- Buttons
- Interactive components
- Visual dividers
- Effects

An Entry can be a **guide**, **wiki**, **story**, **project page**, **ruleset**, or **system document**.

#### Where Entries Live

Entries can exist in:
- 🌍 **Global** - Appear in Global feed
- 🪐 **Space** - Space-level content
- 🧩 **Channel** - Belong to specific channels
- 👤 **User** (profile) - Personal entries

**An Entry can be promoted** (e.g., from Space → Global).

#### Visual Expression

Entries can:
- Inherit Space theme
- Override with author theme
- Apply glow effects
- Apply motion
- Use layered layouts

**Content becomes designed, not dumped.**

---

## Identity System

Users have **multi-layered identity** to avoid context collapse.

### Global Profile
Each user has:
- One global account
- Global settings
- Global achievements
- Subscriptions

### Per-Space Identity
Inside each Space, a user can have:
- Different name
- Different avatar
- Different frame
- Different roles
- Different visibility

This allows:
- **Professionalism** in one Space
- **Creativity** in another
- **Anonymity** where needed

### Per-Channel Identity (Masks)
Channels may further define:
- Nicknames
- Permissions
- Visual markers

**Identity is contextual, not fixed.**

| Context | Type of Chat | Identity Used |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Global  | DM / Group  | Global Profile |
| Space   | DM / Group  | Space Identity |
| Channel | Chat        | Channel Mask   |

---

## Chat System

Glow includes comprehensive chat capabilities:
- **Global chats** - DMs and group chats with global identity
- **Space chats** - DMs and group chats within Space context
- **Channel chats** - Real-time messaging in channels

### Chat Bubbles

Chat bubbles are:
- **Styled** - Custom appearance
- **Layered** - Visual depth
- **Contextual** - Adapt to environment (Global/Space/Channel)
- **Optionally animated** - Based on Glow tier

They can:
- Inherit Space style
- Inherit user style
- Reflect Glow tier (Legacy, Glow, Glow Up)

### Stickers and Effects

Chats support:
- Stickers
- Visual effects
- Animated accents
- Premium effects (Glow Up)

---

## Visual System — Glow

**Glow** is a **living UI system**, not static theming.

### Core Visual Modes

#### Legacy Mode
- Static UI
- No animations
- No glow
- Battery-friendly
- Low-end device support

#### Glow Mode (Default)
- Soft glow
- Gentle pulses
- Glassmorphism
- Depth
- Subtle motion

#### Glow Up (Premium)
- Multi-color glow
- Advanced gradients
- Pulses, flow, flicker
- Animated chat bubbles
- Profile frames
- Entry effects

### Visual Scope

Glow applies to:
- UI components
- Entries
- Smart Blocks
- Separators
- Chat bubbles
- Profile frames
- Navigation elements

### Performance Philosophy

Glow is:
- **Synchronized** - All motion follows a global clock
- **Selective** - Only necessary elements animate
- **Non-blocking** - Does not interfere with interaction
- **GPU-friendly** - Hardware-accelerated when possible

---

## Theme System & Cascading Styles

Glow uses a **hierarchical cascade system** for styling.

### Style Priority Order

1. **Object-specific** (entry, block, bubble)
2. **User theme** (if premium)
3. **Channel theme**
4. **Space theme**
5. **Global default theme**

Lower levels override higher levels.

### Synchronization

All visual motion:
- Follows a **global clock**
- Stays **rhythmically consistent**
- Avoids **chaotic animation**

This creates a **coherent, living interface**.

---

---

## Terminology (Strict - ALWAYS Use)

### Primary Concepts

- **Global** - Top-level feed and social layer
- **Spaces** - Immersive communities with unique visual identity
- **Channels** - Composite immersive areas (chats + entries) within Spaces
- **Entries** - Block-based content pieces (NOT "posts")
- **Masks** - Per-channel identity customization (nicknames, avatars)

### Content Types

- **Entry** - Block-based content (like Notion pages)
- **Chat Message** - Real-time text message
- **Voice Message** - Audio communication

### NEVER Use These Terms

❌ "posts" → Use **Entries**
❌ "groups" (for spaces) → Use **Spaces**
❌ "servers" → Use **Spaces**
❌ "communities" (when referring to Spaces) → Use **Spaces**
❌ "messages" (for entries) → Use **Entries**
❌ "channels" (for DMs) → Use **DMs** or **Group Chats**

---

## Experience & Aesthetics

Glow is designed for **immersion**:

- **Dark-first aesthetic** with glow/neon accents
- **Atmospheric UI** - depth, shadows, ambient effects
- **Smooth, intentional animations** - nothing feels abrupt
- **Sense of place** - each Space feels distinct

Aesthetics aren't decoration. They're **foundational** to the experience. Visual identity reinforces each Space's character.

**Entering a Space should feel like stepping into another world**, not just opening another tab.

---

## Tech Stack

```yaml
Framework: Flutter 3.19+
State: Riverpod 2.5+ (compatible with Isar)
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
Local DB: Isar 3.1+ (Offline-first)
HTTP: Dio
Navigation: GoRouter
Monorepo: Melos
Code generation: Mason, build_runner
```

### Architecture

**Clean Architecture** with strict layer separation:

```
Presentation (UI, Widgets, State)
    ↓
Domain (Entities, UseCases, Business Logic)
    ↓
Data (Repositories, DTOs, Mappers)
    ↓
Infrastructure (Supabase, Isar, APIs)
```

**Dependencies flow inward only.** Presentation can depend on Domain, but Domain cannot depend on Data or Presentation.

### Packages

- `glow_core` - Base contracts, utilities, error handling
- `glow_domain` - Entities, use cases, business rules
- `glow_data` - Repositories, data sources, offline-first storage
- `glow_api` - HTTP client, API DTOs, endpoints
- `glow_auth` - Session and authentication
- `glow_realtime` - WebSocket connections, presence, sync
- `glow_blocks_engine` - Entry content engine (Notion-like blocks)
- `glow_blocks_flutter` - Block rendering widgets
- `glow_observability` - Logging, analytics, crash reporting
- `glow_ui` - Design system (atoms, molecules, organisms)

---

## Offline-First Strategy

Glow works **100% offline** with transparent background sync.

### Data Flow
```
User action
    ↓
Save to Isar (local) immediately
    ↓
Queue for sync (SyncOperationIsarModel)
    ↓
Sync to Supabase when online
    ↓
UI shows sync status (pending ⏳ / synced ✅ / error ❌)
```

### Key Principles
- ✅ App functions fully offline (view, create, edit content)
- ✅ Local-first: Isar is source of truth for UI
- ✅ Background sync: Transparent to user
- ✅ Conflict resolution: Last-write-wins with server authority
- ✅ Visual feedback: Sync status on Entries and messages
- ✅ Resilience: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

See [`docs/OFFLINE_FIRST_STRATEGY.md`](docs/OFFLINE_FIRST_STRATEGY.md) for implementation details.
